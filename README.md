[Band Protocol](https://bandprotocol.com) is a protocol for decentralized data governance on public blockchains. The protocol incentivizes multiple independent parties to work cooperatively to provide trusted data for [decentralized applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application) on-chain. For more information on how the protocol works, visit the  [developer portal](https://developers.bandprotocol.com).

This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) containing Band Protocol's smart contracts and variuous supporting tools and libraries. See below for the breakdown and explanation of each folder. Note that each folder is its own independent module with separate license and README.
